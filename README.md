# Project Overview
Brain strokes are a leading cause of death worldwide, and early prediction can significantly reduce the risk by enabling timely medical interventions.
This project allows users to input their medical data and receive real-time predictions regarding their stroke risk.

# Objective:
Develop a robust system for predicting the likelihood of brain strokes based on medical parameters.
Key Features:
Accuracy: Implements machine learning models trained with real-world datasets.
Accessibility: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for easy usability.

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Framework: Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.
